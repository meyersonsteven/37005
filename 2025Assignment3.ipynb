    "Currency options are often quoted in the market in terms of implied volatilities, for at–the–money (ATM), and for 25% and 10% \"delta\" risk reversals (RR) and butterflies (BF). The quoted ATM volatility is the Black/Scholes implied volatility of an option with strike equal to the forward exchange rate. The \"implied volatility\" of an $x\\%$ delta risk reversal is given by the difference between the Black/Scholes implied volatility of an $x\\%$ delta out–of–the–money call and the Black/Scholes implied volatility of an $x\\%$ delta out–of–the–money put. The \"implied volatility\" of an $x\\%$ delta butterfly is given by the average of the Black/Scholes implied volatility of an $x\\%$ delta out–of–the–money call and the Black/Scholes implied volatility of an $x\\%$ delta out–of–the–money put, minus the ATM volatility.
